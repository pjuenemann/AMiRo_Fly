abstract = "This paper presents an approach that uses planar information (homography matrix) to build a visual 2D occupancy grid map from monocular vision. Initially, a segmentation step is necessary to classify parts of the image in floor or non floor. From this classification is possible to determine which parts of the image are free and which parts of the image are obstacles. Practical results are presented to validate the proposal."
